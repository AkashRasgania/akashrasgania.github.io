                <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">Dark Web - A Visit To The Darkness </h2>
                <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Internet is a power, and with great power comes great responsibility. Safeguarding the internet is challenging task for the cybersecurity professionals & law enforcement agencies. With a motivation and curiosity to understand the intricacies of Cybersecurity, I visited the unexplored part of the internet, called dark web. Although, it had been explored by other individuals also, before me, but it is something which we do not visit usually & should not visit without the knowledge of proper usage. At the time, I did not knew either, the correct method to safely browse the dark web. </p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Knowing it's risks and consequences I decided to continue. I had installed the TOR browser, which is the gate key to the dark web. It is a special browser from, Tor Projects, initially developed by the US Navy in 1990 for the secret communication of navy's information. It works on the onion routing method & has its own set of tor servers, the data is relayed from different tor servers making it difficult to trace back to the origin. Websites on the tor network have their own specialized domain name ending with ".onion".  These websites cannot be view on normal browsers, as it requires specialized browser like tor.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">A safe method to browse tor, is to use VPNs before connecting to tor network. After I connected to the tor network, the task was to find the ".onion" websites. For this, there are search engines available on the dark web similar to as of google search engine, maybe more optimized. Searching was an easier task. After a bit of searching, I landed on a webpage which had a list of tor websites. It was a platform like the you tube, but not with a legal contents, I can say that. It consisted of harmful videos of assaults, murders, sexual harassments & more. All categories which are considered as illegal might be there, and is strictly not recommend to be visited. The harsh reality is that they charge money for such content & considering the fact that they are getting paid by individuals, undoubtedly in Cryptocurrencies.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Surfing a bit more, I came to a pharmaceutical website, which was selling surely not legal mediational/addictive narcotic substances. Later, I found a platform, having chat groups containing offensive messages and selling of illegal content, these are amongst the reason of terrorisms, including cyber terrorism. Law enforcement & intelligence agencies struggles hard for the monitoring of such activities and deterioration of anti-national plans.</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">Browsing dark web, I had a experience similar to telegram. Telegram is not exactly used to surf dark web, but due to its privacy policies and working model, it serves as a smaller version of deep web. There are activities as discussed, taking place everyday which are not noticed. It leave us in a deep shock about the harsh reality of the dark world.</p>
